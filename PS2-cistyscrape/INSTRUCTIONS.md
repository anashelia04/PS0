# Problem Set 2: Cityscape

**Purpose:** Practice designing, testing, and implementing Abstract Data Types (ADTs), focusing on mutable types and test-first programming.

**This problem set will help you master:**

- **Test-Driven Development:** Writing tests _before_ implementation to guide your design and ensure correctness.
- **Abstract Data Type Design:** Creating well-specified and robust ADTs.
- **Representation Invariants and Abstraction Functions:** Documenting and enforcing data integrity.
- **Preventing Rep Exposure:** Designing ADTs to protect their internal representations.
- **Working with Mutable Data Types:** Understanding the challenges and best practices for mutable objects.
- **Using Generics:** Creating flexible and reusable ADTs that work with different types of data.

**Get the Code:**

1.  **GitHub Repository:** PS2-cistyscrape is under main branch of https://github.com/Mathe-S/ITSEPC-Problem-sets
    You need to run

    ```
    git pull origin main
    ```

    to update your local repository to the main branch.

2.  **Install:** Navigate into your cloned directory in the terminal (`cd ps2-yourusername`) and run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
3.  **Open in VS Code:** Open the `ps2-yourusername` folder in VS Code to start working on the problem set.

**Overview:**

In this problem set, you'll be building software to model a virtual city! You'll create two main toolboxes (ADTs):

- **`RegionSet` ADT (Problems 1-3):** A 2D map representing labeled, contiguous regions of land in your city. You'll implement _two different versions_ of this toolbox to see different ways of storing data.
- **`City` ADT (Problem 4):** A 3D city model, built using your `RegionSet` toolbox to represent building floors.

**Problems:**

- **Problems 1-3: `RegionSet` ADT:**

  - **Problem 1: Test `RegionSet<string>`:** Write comprehensive tests in `RegionSetTest.ts` for the `RegionSet` ADT, focusing on string labels initially.
  - **Problem 2: Implement `RepMapRegionSet<L>`:** Implement the `RegionSet` ADT using a `Map` as its internal representation in `src/RegionSetImpl.ts`. First implement it for `string` labels, then make it generic to handle labels of any type `L`.
  - **Problem 3: Implement `RepArrayRegionSet<L>`:** Implement a _second_ version of the `RegionSet` ADT, `RepArrayRegionSet`, using a 2D `Array` as its internal representation, also in `src/RegionSetImpl.ts`. Make it generic as well.

- **Problem 4: `City<L>` ADT:**
  - **Problem 4.1: Test `City<L>`:** Write tests for the `City` ADT in `CityTest.ts`.
  - **Problem 4.2: Implement `City<L>`:** Implement the `City` ADT in `src/City.ts`, using your `RegionSet` ADT as a building block to represent building floors.

**Design Freedom and Restrictions:**

- **Design Freedom:** You have significant design freedom for choosing classes, methods, and helper functions within `src/RegionSetImpl.ts` and `src/City.ts`.
- **Restrictions:**
  - **Follow Specifications:** You **must** adhere to the specifications provided in the `RegionSet.ts` and `City.ts` interfaces. Do not change these specifications.
  - **File Names:** Do not change the filenames for `algorithm.ts`, `algorithmTest.ts`, etc.
  - **Function Signatures:** Do not change the signatures of exported functions.
  - **Exported Items:** Do not export any new items from `src/algorithm.ts` beyond the specified functions.
  - **Strengthening `getHint()`:** For `getHint()` in PS1, you were allowed to strengthen the spec. In PS2, you must implement the provided specs as-is.

**Iterative Workflow (Recommended Steps):**

For **each function** and **ADT** you implement, follow this iterative workflow:

1.  **Understand the Specifications:** Carefully read the TypeDoc comments in the provided `src/*.ts` files to fully understand the requirements (preconditions, postconditions, behavior).
2.  **Write Tests First:**
    - **Testing Strategy:** Devise and document a clear testing strategy in the test file (`RegionSetTest.ts`, `CityTest.ts`). Use partitioning to cover different input and output scenarios.
    - **Test Cases:** Write small, focused Mocha test cases (using `it(...)`) in the test files, based on your testing strategy. Remember to test for both typical cases and edge cases.
3.  **Implement:** Write the TypeScript code for the function or ADT in the appropriate `src/*.ts` file. Focus on correctness, clarity, and following the specifications.
4.  **Test and Debug:** Run your tests (`npm test`). If tests fail, debug your implementation, revise your code, and re-run tests until they pass.
5.  **Commit and Push:** Use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to save your work to Git after each significant step (writing tests, implementing a function, fixing a bug).

**Important Testing Advice:**

- **Partitioning:** Use input and output partitioning to create a thorough and effective test suite.
- **Testing Strategy Comments:** Document your testing strategy at the top of each test file.
- **Small Test Cases:** Keep your test cases small and focused, testing specific partitions.
- **Test for Bugs:** Design tests that specifically try to expose potential bugs and violations of the specifications.
- **Legal Clients:** Ensure your tests are legal clients of the specifications â€“ do not make assumptions beyond what the spec guarantees.
- **`it()` Functions:** Put each test case in its own `it()` function for better error reporting and debugging.
- **Coverage Tool:** Use `npm run coverage` to check code coverage and identify areas not adequately tested.
- **`strictEqual` & `deepStrictEqual`:** Use `assert.strictEqual` for primitive types and `assert.deepStrictEqual` for comparing data structures (arrays, sets, maps, object literals).
- **Helper Functions in Tests:** Be careful about calling helper functions from your test code. Helper functions for testing should go in the `test/` folder, or in `src/utils.ts` if needed by both test and implementation code.
- **Avoid Large Test Inputs:** Keep test inputs reasonably sized to avoid performance issues and focus on testing logic, not resource exhaustion.

**Important Implementation Advice:**

- **Abstraction Function (AF) & Representation Invariant (RI):** For each class you implement, document the AF and RI as comments near the field declarations in your `.ts` files. Also document how you prevent Rep Exposure. See the "Documenting the AF, RI, & SRE" reading for guidance.
- **`checkRep()`:** Implement a `checkRep()` method in each class to assert the RI at runtime. Call `checkRep()` at the end of every creator, producer, and mutator method.
- **`toString()`:** Implement a useful `toString()` method for debugging.
- **Helper Functions:**
  - **Small Private Helpers:** For small, implementation-specific helper functions, define them as `private` within your classes in `src/*.ts`. These don't need separate tests.
  - **Larger or Reusable Helpers:** For more complex or reusable helper functions, create them in `src/utils.ts` and write tests for them in `test/utilsTest.ts`. Export these helpers from `utils.ts`.
  - **No Testing Code in `src/`:** Do not put helper functions intended _only_ for testing in `src/`. Keep test-specific helpers in `test/`.
- **Eliminate Warnings:** Address all TypeScript compiler and ESLint warnings in VS Code to improve code quality.
- **Code Review:** Review your own code critically for clarity, correctness, and adherence to the "Safe from Bugs," "Easy to Understand," and "Ready for Change" principles.
- **Test Frequently:** Run your tests after every code change to catch bugs early.
- **`npm test -- -f 'pattern'`:** Use this command to run specific tests matching a pattern, useful for focused debugging.
- **`console.log` & `util.inspect`:** Use `console.log` with multiple arguments or `util.inspect()` for more helpful debugging output, especially for complex objects like Maps and Sets.
- **Commit Frequently:** Commit and push your work to Git regularly to save progress and enable collaboration.
